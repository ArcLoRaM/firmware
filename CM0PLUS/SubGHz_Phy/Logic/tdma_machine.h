 * How early a node wakes before the nominal start of a slot it will

 *
 * \details Every scheduled packet starts on air exactly at its slot's nominal
 *          start. The lead covers the variable work before the radio fires:
 *          wake from Stop2, slot task, logs, compliance, payload build. The
 *          radio's own start-up is in the platform's Tx ramp. The node then waits for the nominal start minus the
 *          platform's \c tx_ramp_ms and fires. A slot task that reaches the
 *          fire instant late logs \c TX_LATE (and drops a Sync packet).
 *          Sender-local: receivers never use it. Bench worst case 13 ms from
 *          wake to on-air, cell 0 of the Sync phase (2026-09-26).
 *
 * \remark Must not exceed \ref MAX_GUARD_TIME_MS: gaps are sized for wakes up
 *         to that early (every gap >= 2 x \ref MAX_GUARD_TIME_MS).
