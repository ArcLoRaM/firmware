# Issue #60: one capture process records every port for 24 h

Purpose: acceptance. Issue: #60 (open, deferred: not urgent as of 2026-10-02).

Code done (`4f71ff3`, `1fc6e1f`); a reset check passed on 2026-09-29. Left: the issue's 24 h criterion.

## Scenarios

No scenario file: the check is on the always-on capture itself (`bench capture`), not on a `bench run`.

## Hardware

| Item | Needed |
|---|---|
| Three boards on USB (COM6, COM8, COM9 on 2026-09-29; `bench boards` decides) | yes |
| The COM6 board (dead radio, trace UART only) | yes, for the replug step |
| Host on AC power, Windows sleep off, USB selective suspend off, for the whole 24 h | yes |

Hands on the bench: one USB replug of the COM6 board (step 3).

## Protocol

1. T0: preconditions met; `bench capture status` shows one process recording all three ports. Write down its PID and the UTC time.
2. T0 + about 1 h: `bench reset 2`. Write down the UTC time.
3. T0 + about 2 h: unplug the COM6 board's USB for 30 s, then plug it back. Write down both UTC times.
4. Leave it until T0 + 24 h. `bench run`s may happen in the window: they read the capture files and never open a port.
5. T0 + 24 h: `bench capture status` shows the same PID still recording all three ports.

## Criteria

- [ ] **Coverage.** For each port, the files of both UTC days together run from T0 to T0 + 24 h; the first host timestamp of the second day's file is within 5 s of the last of the first day's.
- [ ] **No silent gap.** A board running the TDMA machine logs a `SLOT` every 3 s, so a gap over 10 s in host timestamps on COM8/COM9 is a capture fault. For COM6, take its cadence from the first hour. The only allowed gap is COM6 during the replug (unplugged time + one 2 s reconnect period).
- [ ] **Reset.** At step 2, COM9 has both cores' `BOOT` and `CORE_SYNC stage=linked`; COM6 and COM8 keep recording through that minute.
- [ ] **Replug.** `capture.err` logs COM6 unavailable once (not at every retry); COM6 lines resume within 5 s of the replug.
- [ ] **Downstream unchanged.** `arclog merge` on the six files prints one time-ordered stream; `arclog report` on them completes with no schema problems and no lost lines on the C3 and C2.
- [ ] **Errors.** `capture.err` holds only the startup lines, the COM6 replug, and port outages that recovered on their own.

## Findings

- 2026-09-29: the capture stopped after 52 min (both ports at once, `ClearCommError PermissionError(13)`, never recovered in the files).
- 2026-10-01 21:23:39-21:30:55 UTC: the same error on both ports at once; the Windows System log shows the host entering sleep at that instant and resuming at 21:30:55. The laptop was on battery (sleep after 10 min on battery, 15 min on AC). The capture (pid 14892) reconnected both ports by itself after the resume. The 2026-09-29 drop is very likely the same sleep.
- Since 2026-10-01 the host has sleep off on AC. Sleep on battery is still 15 min: keep it on AC for any long run.

## Runs

| Date (UTC) | Scenario | Build ID | Verdict | Record | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-29 00:16 | always-on capture | `66a35a2-d67ece1` | FAIL (bench) | `tools/arclog/runs/bench/com8-20260929.log`, `com9-20260929.log` | Stopped after 52 min, both ports at once. |
| 2026-10-01 21:16 | always-on capture | (several) | outage, recovered | `tools/arclog/runs/bench/capture.err` | Host sleep 21:23:39-21:30:55; reconnected on resume. |
