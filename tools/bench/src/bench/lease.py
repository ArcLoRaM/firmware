"""Board leases: a command that works on a board holds it, so two sessions never share one (ADR-0003).

A lease is an advisory file lock (flock) on `<dir>/<board id>.lease`, so the operating system
releases it when the holding process ends, however it ends: nothing goes stale and nobody
bookkeeps. Taking is never blocking: a board held by another session is refused at once, with who
holds it, and the caller picks other boards or waits.

- exclusive: flash, reset, read a UID over SWD. One holder; its description is written in the file.
- shared: watch a board's trace in a run. Any number of watchers, but no flasher while watched.

Reading a board's trace is never leased: the capture is shared and read-only.
